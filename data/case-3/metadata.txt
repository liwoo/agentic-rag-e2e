Sector: Central government, Education
Decision: FOI 36(2)(b)(ii): Not upheld, FOI 36(2)(c): Not upheld, FOI 17(1): Upheld
Abstract: The complainant submitted a meta request to Sport England; that is, a request about a previous request. Sport England withheld the information under sections 41 and 43(2) of FOIA. It has subsequently advised that it considers that sections 40(2), 36(2)(b) and 36(2)(c) are also engaged. These exemptions concern information provided in confidence, commercial interests, personal data and prejudice to the effective conduct of public affairs, respectively. The Commissioner’s decision is that the withheld information engages sections 36(2)(b)(ii) and 36(2)(c) of FOIA. Sport England’s late application of these exemptions and section 40(2) means that its refusal notice didn’t comply with section 17(1) but the Commissioner doesn’t require it to take any steps.
