The council provided information in response to part 1 and 2 of the request. It also confirmed it was withholding information under section 40 of FOIA (third party personal information), but did not specify what part of the request this applied to. At the internal review stage, the council provided the complainant with some additional information, and subsequently confirmed that this was all of the information it had previously considered to be exempt from disclosure under section 40. The Commissioner considers that there was one objective reading of the request, and that the council interpreted the request in line with this objective reading. The Commissioner is also satisfied that, on the balance of probabilities, the council has provided all of the information held that falls within scope of the one objective reading of the request and has complied with section 1(1)(b). However, as the council failed to confirm in both its initial response, and in its internal review response, whether it held, or did not hold, information falling within scope of parts 3 and 4 of the complainant’s request, the Commissioner has found a breach of section 1(1)(a) of FOIA. In addition, as the council failed to provide any information in response to the request, or issue a refusal notice citing its reliance on section 40 to withhold part of the information, within 20 working days, the Commissioner has found a breach of section 10, and section 17, respectively.",

The Commissioner’s decision is that none of the exemptions cited by the FCDO provide a basis upon which it can refuse to confirm or deny whether it holds information falling within the scope of the request.",

      "description": "The complainant requested information from Derby City Council (“the Council”) about a footpath by the River Derwent. The Council provided some information, but stated that some information was not held. It also refused two parts of the request under regulation 12(4)(b) – manifestly unreasonable, on grounds of the burden of cost and time. The Commissioner is satisfied that the Council does not hold any information falling within the scope of part 3) of the request. However, he is not satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that the Council does not hold more information relating to part 1). He has also found that the exception at regulation 12(4)(b) is not engaged, in respect of parts 2) and 4) of the request. Further, the Commissioner has found that the Council breached the requirements of regulations 5(2), 14(2) and 11(4): time for response and refusal notice, and time for reconsideration (internal review). The Commissioner requires the Council to take the following steps to ensure compliance with the legislation. Provide a fresh response to part 1) after carrying out further searches aimed at identifying all the information it holds within scope. The Commissioner stresses that the Council must consider the specific request and ensure that it responds. If the Council locates relevant information and decides to apply a new exception, it must clearly communicate this to the complainant. If, following searches, the Council wishes to maintain its position that no further information is held, it must be able to clearly demonstrate that it has performed adequate searches before arriving at this conclusion. Provide a fresh response to parts 2) and 4) of the request that does not rely on regulation 12(4)(b) of the EIR.",

However, he finds that it was entitled to refuse to confirm whether or not it held the requested information for questions four and five on the basis of section 40(5B) of FOIA.

The Commissioner requires the Trust to take the following steps to ensure compliance with the legislation: Confirm or deny that it holds recorded information within scope of questions one and three of the request. If it does hold recorded information, it should either disclose it or provide a refusal notice in accordance with its obligations under section 17 of FOIA.",
